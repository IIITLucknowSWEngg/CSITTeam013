- **Frontend Developers:** 
These developers are responsible for creating the client-side 
experience of the platform. They work on making the interface 
visually appealing, ensuring that users can easily browse, search, and 
play content across devices (e.g., mobile, web, smart TV). They 
ensure the platform is responsive, intuitive, and fast. 

- **Backend Developers:** 
Backend developers manage the server-side logic, databases, and 
integrations. They handle tasks like user authentication, content 
delivery, streaming optimization, and ensuring high availability during 
peak traffic. They also work on content delivery networks (CDNs) for 
smooth streaming.

Possess expertise in both frontend and backend development. They 
bridge the gap between the two, they ensure the platform’s 
functionality is cohesive, efficient, and scalable, providing end-to-end 
solutions that work seamlessly from server to user interface. 

- **QA Testers:** 
Quality Assurance (QA) testers ensure that the platform runs 
smoothly across various browsers and devices. They run tests to 
identify bugs, check for broken functionality, and ensure that user 
interactions (e.g., payments, profile creation, and video playback) 
happen without issues. They also test performance under high traffic 
loads. 

### 2.2 Design Team 
- **UI/UX Designers:** 
UI/UX designers focus on creating a user-friendly interface that is 
easy to navigate, providing users with an enjoyable experience. They design 
menus, recommendations, and layouts in a way  
that maximizes user engagement and content discovery.

They are responsible for designing the platform’s branding elements, 
including logos, banners, and promotional visuals. They also help with 
designing thumbnails and artwork for movies, TV shows,  and other 
content, ensuring consistency in the visual style. 

### 2.3 Product Management 
- **Product Managers:** 
Product managers oversee the overall direction and feature 
development of the platform. They prioritize tasks for the 
development team based on user feedback, business goals, and    
competitive research. They ensure that features like search, 
recommendations, and content discovery are implemented to meet 
both user needs and business targets. 

- **Business Analysts:** 
Business analysts use data-driven insights to inform decisions about 
platform updates, feature rollouts, and content curation. They track 
user behaviour, viewing trends, and subscription patterns to suggest 
improvements and optimizations, increasing user retention and 
engagement. 

## 3. External Stakeholders 

### 3.1 Users 
- **Free Users:** 
These users access a limited range of content with ads. They typically 
serve as a base for potential premium users. Their feedback on ads 
and free content is important to improve monetization strategies and 
user experience. 

- **Subscribers (Premium Users):** 
Premium users pay for access to exclusive content or ad-free 
streaming. They are the main source of revenue and their experience 
is prioritized, with exclusive benefits like early access to content, 
higher video quality, or exclusive shows. Their satisfaction drives 
retention and growth of the platform. 

### 3.2 Content Providers
- **Production Houses/Studios:** 
Major production studios provide blockbuster movies, TV shows, and 
live sports events to the platform. The content provided by them 
often drives subscriptions and user engagement. The platform 
negotiates deals with these providers to secure streaming rights, 
often for exclusive or original content. 

- **Independent Creators:** 
This segment includes content creators who offer niche or user
generated content (e.g., indie films, web series). Platforms like this 
can give them a space to distribute their work, sometimes offering 
revenue-sharing models based on views or subscriptions. 

### 3.3 Advertisers 
- **Brands/Companies:** 
Brands purchase ad placements on the platform, particularly for free 
users. Ads can appear before, during, or after content, in various 
formats like video ads, banner ads, or sponsorships. The platform 
provides targeted advertising options to brands, based on user 
demographics, preferences, and behaviour, to increase ad relevance 
and effectiveness. 

## 4. Investors 

- **Venture Capitalists:**
Venture capitalists provide early-stage funding to help the platform 
grow, supporting feature development, content acquisition, and user 
acquisition strategies. VCs are usually interested in high-growth 
potential and expect returns through future profits or an eventual 
exit (e.g., IPO, acquisition). 

- **Private Equity Investors:** 
These investors might invest at a later stage, usually looking for 
established businesses with steady cash flow. Their role might involve 
scaling the platform or expanding into new markets. 

## 5. Partners

- **Technology Partners:** 
Tech partners provide the necessary infrastructure for content 
delivery. This includes cloud service providers like AWS or Google 
Cloud, which host the platform’s data, manage load balancing, and 
support video streaming at scale. CDN (Content Delivery Network) 
providers help in ensuring fast, smooth streaming globally. 

- **Payment Gateways:** 
Payment gateway partners, like Stripe or PayPal, handle subscription 
payments, ensuring a seamless and secure checkout process for 
premium users. Their integration allows users to pay using various 
methods (credit card, debit card, mobile wallets) across multiple 
regions. 

- **Telecom Partners:** 
Telecom companies might bundle the platform's subscription with 
their services (e.g., mobile plans with free streaming access). This 
helps expand the user base and drive subscriber growth through 
partner promotions.

## 6. Regulatory Bodies 

- **Data Privacy Regulators:** 
The platform must comply with international and regional data 
protection regulations, such as GDPR (General Data Protection 
Regulation) in Europe or CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act). 
These rules govern how user data is collected, stored, and used. 
Ensuring compliance is essential to avoid fines and maintain user 
trust. 

- **Content Censorship Authorities:** 
Different regions have varying censorship laws that regulate the kind 
of content that can be shown. The platform must ensure that it 
follows regional guidelines on issues like violence, adult content, 
political messaging, and more. Failure to comply can lead to fines or 
being banned in certain regions.
