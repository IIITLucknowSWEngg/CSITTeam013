engagement. 

## 3. External Stakeholders 

### 3.1 Users 
- **Free Users:** 
These users access a limited range of content with ads. They typically 
serve as a base for potential premium users. Their feedback on ads 
and free content is important to improve monetization strategies and 
user experience. 

- **Subscribers (Premium Users):** 
Premium users pay for access to exclusive content or ad-free 
streaming. They are the main source of revenue and their experience 
is prioritized, with exclusive benefits like early access to content, 
higher video quality, or exclusive shows. Their satisfaction drives 
retention and growth of the platform. 

### 3.2 Content Providers
- **Production Houses/Studios:** 
Major production studios provide blockbuster movies, TV shows, and 
live sports events to the platform. The content provided by them 
often drives subscriptions and user engagement. The platform 
negotiates deals with these providers to secure streaming rights, 
often for exclusive or original content. 

- **Independent Creators:** 
This segment includes content creators who offer niche or user
generated content (e.g., indie films, web series). Platforms like this 
can give them a space to distribute their work, sometimes offering 
revenue-sharing models based on views or subscriptions. 

### 3.3 Advertisers 
- **Brands/Companies:** 
Brands purchase ad placements on the platform, particularly for free 
users. Ads can appear before, during, or after content, in various 
formats like video ads, banner ads, or sponsorships. The platform 
provides targeted advertising options to brands, based on user 
demographics, preferences, and behaviour, to increase ad relevance 
and effectiveness. 

## Investors 

- **Venture Capitalists:**
Venture capitalists provide early-stage funding to help the platform 
grow, supporting feature development, content acquisition, and user 
acquisition strategies. VCs are usually interested in high-growth 
potential and expect returns through future profits or an eventual 
exit (e.g., IPO, acquisition). 

- **Private Equity Investors:** 
These investors might invest at a later stage, usually looking for 
established businesses with steady cash flow. Their role might involve 
scaling the platform or expanding into new markets.
