# Software Design Description (SDD)  

## 1. Introduction  

### 1.1 Purpose  
The purpose of this Software Design Description (SDD) is to provide a detailed design for the **Nova Digital streaming application**. This document outlines the software's architecture, components, interfaces, and interactions to ensure the implementation meets the system's functional and non-functional requirements.  

### 1.2 Scope  
The Nova Digital system allows users to stream movies, TV shows, sports, and live events across multiple devices. It supports subscription-based and ad-supported models. The system includes mobile and web applications, backend API services, real-time streaming, payment integration, and third-party services like CDN and analytics tools.  

---  

## 2. System Overview  
The Nova Digital system is composed of three main modules:  

1. **Client Applications**  
   - Mobile Apps (iOS, Android)  
   - Web Application (Browser-based UI)  
2. **Backend System**  
   - Content Management  
   - Subscription Management  
   - Streaming Services  
3. **External Services**  
   - Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)  
   - Payment Gateways  
   - Analytics Tools  

The system operates across devices, using REST and GraphQL APIs to interact with the backend. Streaming is facilitated via adaptive bitrate technology to ensure a smooth experience on varying network speeds.  

---  

## 3. Architecture Design  

### 3.1 Architecture Components  

#### User Interfaces  

1. **Viewer Application**  
   - User Registration/Login  
   - Search and Discover Content  
   - Play Video (VOD and Live Streaming)  
   - Subscription Management  
   - Download for Offline Viewing  

2. **Admin Dashboard**  
   - Content Upload and Management  
   - User Analytics and Reports  
   - Moderation Tools for Content Review  

---  

### 3.2 Backend Services  

1. **Authentication**  
   - Token-based authentication (OAuth2, JWT).  
2. **Content Management Service**  
   - Upload, categorize, and organize video content.  
   - Metadata management (genres, actors, descriptions).  
3. **Subscription Service**  
   - Manages plans, pricing, and user subscriptions.  
4. **Streaming Service**  
   - Adaptive bitrate streaming using HLS or DASH protocols.  
   - Ensures DRM protection for premium content.  
5. **Payment Integration**  
   - Handles payments, refunds, and subscription renewals via gateways like Razorpay or PayPal.  
6. **Recommendation Engine**  
   - AI/ML-based personalized content suggestions based on user history and preferences.  

---  

### 3.3 Databases  

1. **PostgreSQL**  
   - Stores structured data (user profiles, subscription details, content metadata).  
2. **Redis**  
   - Caching frequently accessed data (e.g., trending content).  
3. **NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB)**  
   - Stores unstructured data like watch history and personalized recommendations.  

---  

### 3.4 External APIs  

1. **CDN (e.g., Akamai, Cloudflare)**  
   - Ensures high-speed delivery of video content.  
2. **Payment Gateway**  
   - Secure online transactions.  
3. **Analytics (e.g., Google Analytics, Mixpanel)**  
   - Tracks user engagement and application performance.  

---  

### 3.5 Infrastructure  

1. **Hosting**  
   - Cloud platforms like AWS or Google Cloud for high availability.  
2. **Load Balancer**  
   - Traffic distribution using tools like Nginx or AWS ELB.  
3. **Monitoring Tools**  
   - Tools like Prometheus and Grafana for system health checks.  
4. **CI/CD Pipeline**  
   - Automated deployments via GitHub Actions or Jenkins.  

---  

### 3.6 Workflow Overview  

1. **Content Playback**  
   - User selects a video to play.  
   - Backend fetches video details and CDN URL.  
   - Player requests video streams using adaptive bitrate technology.  
2. **Subscription Management**  
   - User subscribes to a plan via payment gateway.  
   - Backend verifies payment and updates subscription status.  
3. **Content Recommendations**  
   - User activity is logged and analyzed.  
   - Recommendation engine updates personalized suggestions.  

---  

## 4. Module Design  

### 4.1 Client Application (Frontend)  

1. **User Interface (UI)**  
   - Home Screen: Display banners and featured content.  
   - Search: Content discovery based on keywords.  
   - Video Player: Supports subtitles, quality adjustment, and playback controls.  
   - Profile: Subscription details, settings, and watchlist.  

2. **Controller Layer**  
   - Manages requests and communicates with the backend.  

3. **Service Layer**  
   - Handles business logic like video playback, recommendations, and subscriptions.  

---  
### 4.2 Backend System  

1. **API Gateway**  
   - Central point for handling client requests.  

2. **Streaming Service**  
   - Manages streaming sessions and ensures DRM compliance.  

3. **Content Management Service**  
   - Handles content ingestion, transcoding, and metadata.  

4. **Recommendation Engine**  
   - Analyzes watch history and suggests content.  

5. **Notification Service**  
   - Sends alerts for new releases, live events, and subscription updates.  

---  

## 5. Database Design  

### Schema Overview  

- **Users**: Stores user profiles, preferences, and subscriptions.  
- **Content**: Stores video metadata and categories.  
- **Subscriptions**: Tracks subscription plans and user associations.  
- **Playback Logs**: Tracks user interactions with content.  

---  

## 6. Interface Design  

### 6.1 API Design  

- **GET /content/{id}**: Fetch content details.  
- **POST /subscription**: Create a subscription.  
- **GET /recommendations**: Fetch personalized content suggestions.  

### 6.2 External System Interfaces  

- **CDN**: Delivers video content to end users.  
- **Payment Gateway**: Processes subscription payments.  
- **Analytics Tools**: Collects data for user insights.  

---  

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements  

1. **Performance**: The system should support 100,000 concurrent streams.  
2. **Scalability**: Backend must scale horizontally to handle peak traffic.  
3. **Availability**: 99.99% uptime with failover mechanisms.  
4. **Security**: End-to-end encryption and secure payment processing.
