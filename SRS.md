5. Non-functional Requirements
5.1 Performance Requirements:
• 
Scalability: The platform should handle millions of concurrent users without service degradation, including streaming at multiple resolutions (e.g., 1080p, 4K).
• Use Case: During the final match of a popular cricket tournament, millions of users log in to stream the event live in 4K. The system automatically scales its resources, ensuring all users experience smooth streaming without buffering or quality degradation.
• 
Latency: Content should load within 2-3 seconds, with minimal buffering, even in high-traffic conditions.
• Use Case: A user browsing the platform clicks on a movie, and the movie starts playing within 2 seconds, even though it’s peak hours with many users online.
• 
Throughput: The system should support multiple streams per user for different devices without affecting performance.
• Use Case: A user starts streaming a show on their TV while another family member streams a different show on their tablet. The platform efficiently handles multiple streams without buffering or reducing quality on either device.
• 
Bandwidth Optimization: Efficient use of bandwidth to ensure streaming quality on both high and low-speed networks.
• Use Case: A user on a slower mobile network streams content in 720p, while a user on high-speed broadband watches the same show in 4K. Both users experience smooth playback due to adaptive streaming based on available bandwidth.
